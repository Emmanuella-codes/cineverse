## Milestones
### 1st milestone: Displaying Movies and Series on Home Page
In this initial phase, my focus was on fetching and displaying movies and TV series data from The Movie Database API (TMDb). I worked on populating the home page with relevant content to engage users from the moment they login.

### 2nd milestone: Search for Movies or Series using Keywords
I refined the user experience by implementing a search feature. Users can now explore the vast collection of movies and TV series using keywords, making it effortless to find their favorites.

### 3rd milestone: Display relevant details of any Movie or Series
To enhance the engagement and knowledge of users, I concentrated on presenting comprehensive details about each movie and TV series. Users can now dive deep into information like title, genres, taglines (where available), images, overview, and more.

### 4th milestone: Display the full cast and crew of any Movie or Series
I created a seamless way for users to explore the individuals behind their favorite movies and series. Users can now get to know the talented cast and crew members in detail.

### 5th milestone: Users can create and add Movies and Series to list


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
